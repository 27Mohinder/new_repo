For linking the email with the Account:
=========================================
1. In below query, edit email id of the customer and check in DB, and take the UUID:
		select * from NCS.CLOUD_USER where EMAIL = 'sanjib.shrestha@firstwavecloud.com';
2. Run the below query by updating the UUID and check if Account is linked with email.
   If we get output, then account is linked with email. If result is blank, then account is not linked.
		select * from NCS.CLOUD_USER_TENANCY where UUID='cf43ca0a46a64ee683c4cabce082721a';
3. If account is not linked, Take the Account ID of the customer and search in PBA. 
   Click on the result (Account ID) and new window will open. Then go to Additional Information,
   and take 'CTID' (ff030f8035c14718b850474593b6a221) of the customer.
4. Then update the below query and execute:
